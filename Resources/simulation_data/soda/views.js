  "description" : "The Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Projection Report is a three-year planning document used to evaluate resources and project balances to determine how much funding has been committed and how much funding is available for potential projects in each of the City’s TIF districts. \r\n\r\nThis report is updated with the latest available information and does not represent a final accounting of funds in any TIF district. Annual audited financial reports are found on the City’s website and are published once a year to reflect the balances and expenditures in each TIF fund. \r\n\r\nThe TIF Projection Report provides estimates of TIF revenue and expenditures in each TIF district in the City of Chicago over a three-year period.\r\n\r\nFunding sources include:\r\n\r\nFund Balance Available to Program: Includes property tax revenue, interest earnings, and miscellaneous revenue from prior years that remains after netting out previous project allocations. Revenue collected in the prior year is typically used to fund obligations in the current year. Some portion of prior-year collections may be used to fund obligations in subsequent years.\r\n\r\nBond/Note Proceeds Available to Program: Funds remaining from a bond sale or note issued to the City by a bank or other lender after accounting for prior project allocations, which may be allocated to projects in the current year.\r\n\r\nEstimated Incremental Property Tax Revenue: Includes projected incremental property tax revenue collections for the current and subsequent two years. Estimates are based on recent equalized assessed values and tax rates and may be adjusted to reflect property tax collection patterns for a particular TIF.\r\n\r\nTransfers include:\r\n\r\nTransfers In: Funds that are transferred into a TIF district for a specific purpose from one or more adjacent TIF districts. \r\n\r\nTransfers Out: Funds that are transferred to one or more adjacent TIF districts for specific purposes.\r\n\r\nCurrent obligations items may include:\r\n\r\nDebt service payments on bonds or notes; payments to private developers pursuant to redevelopment agreements authorized by City Council; costs of public improvements; and costs of capital projects for overlapping taxing districts, such as the Board of Education or the Chicago Park District. The obligations may also include administrative costs that are incurred by the City for the implementation and administration of the Redevelopment Plan associated with each TIF. \r\n\r\nPotential projects include:\r\n\r\nProjects that are currently under consideration and which have not yet received necessary approval(s). In some cases, the dollar amounts listed reflect estimated project costs. As these projects take shape and move through the approval process, they are expected to become an obligation of the TIF.",

Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. In order to protect the privacy of crime victims, addresses are shown at the block level only and specific locations are not identified. Should you have questions about this dataset, you may contact the Research & Development Division of the Chicago Police Department at 312.745.6071 or RandD@chicagopolice.org.\r\nDisclaimer: These crimes may be based upon preliminary information supplied to the Police Department by the reporting parties that have not been verified. The preliminary crime classifications may be changed at a later date based upon additional investigation and there is always the possibility of mechanical or human error. Therefore, the Chicago Police Department does not guarantee (either expressed or implied) the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or correct sequencing of the information and the information should not be used for comparison purposes over time. The Chicago Police Department will not be responsible for any error or omission, or for the use of, or the results obtained from the use of this information.

  "description" : "This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days. Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. In order to protect the privacy of crime victims, addresses are shown at the block level only and specific locations are not identified. Should you have questions about this dataset, you may contact the Research & Development Division of the Chicago Police Department at 312.745.6071 or RandD@chicagopolice.org. Disclaimer: These crimes may be based upon preliminary information supplied to the Police Department by the reporting parties that have not been verified. The preliminary crime classifications may be changed at a later date based upon additional investigation and there is always the possibility of mechanical or human error. Therefore, the Chicago Police Department does not guarantee (either expressed or implied) the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or correct sequencing of the information and the information should not be used for comparison purposes over time. The Chicago Police Department will not be responsible for any error or omission, or for the use of, or the results obtained from the use of this information.

It reflects the City’s operating budget and anticipated grants at the beginning of the fiscal year on January 1, 2011. This dataset displays the positions and related salaries detailed in the budget. The data is extracted directly from the personnel portion of the Appropriation Ordinance. The dataset presents the position titles (without names) and salaries described in the budget, but does not provide a reflection of the current city workforce with full names and salaries. Disclaimer: the “Total Budgeted Units” column displays either A) the number of employees AND vacancies associated with a given position, or B) the number of budgeted units (ie. hours/months) for that position. “Position Control” determines whether Total Budgeted Units column will count employees and vacancies or hours/months, etc. If a Position Control is 1, then employees and vacancies are counted; if a Position Control is 0, then the total number of hours/months, etc. recorded is displayed. Owner: Budget and Management. Frequency: Data is updated annually.

  "description" : "This dataset is a listing of the report status of all residential buildings required to submit a Life Safety Evaluation under city ordinance. Because the Chicago building code has since 1975 required new high-rise residential buildings to be constructed with sprinkler systems, the Life Safety Ordinance mostly impacted high-rise residential buildings constructed prior to 1975.  This dataset does not describe the overall safety of a building, only whether or not the life safety evaluation was submitted and approved by the City of Chicago. Please note that the majority of reports “failed” initially as a result of a new reporting process and changes to building standards. For more information on the City’s life safety ordinance, visit http://bit.ly/ygORcq. Data Owner: Buildings. Frequency: Data is updated monthly.",
